# RobloxAPI

A MediaWiki extension which provides easy access to the Roblox API via parser functions. The Roblox API is generally
very poorly documented, and using ExternalData or Lua can be hard or not viable for all wiki users. This extension aims
to make it easy for you to grab data from Roblox and put it on your wiki.

> [!NOTE]
> This extension is still in development.
